## This is where imma be dropping all my textures that i find or create/recreate

enjoy and MAKE SURE you add ur .iwi files for each camo/glove/calling card/etc, into the correct folder;
```
C:\...\t6\t6r\data\images
```
### note;
didnt think this was necessary, but i DID NOT CREATE nor am i taking credit for creating/contributing to these textures/mods. This is simply a repo of all of the textures ive stacked on my pc.
pls send me links to credit you if any of them are yours and lacking original readme's, licenses, credits etc. Thanks...
