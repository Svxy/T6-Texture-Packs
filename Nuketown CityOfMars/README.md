# INSTRUCTIONS:
## INSTALLING SCRIPTS & TEXTURES

### First of all, obviously since this is a huge project you're going to have to download the files [here]()

1. Head over to your Plutonium folder in AppData
	If you are not sure how to get over to Plutonium folder
	Hold down your windows key & press r-key at the same time.
	Then type in the following "appdata" and hit enter
	Click on a folder called "Local" once the new window pops up.

	Locate a folder called "Plutonium" and open it.
	Now click "storage", then "t6" and proceed to next step.


2. If you don't see folders called "images" & "scripts" in your "t6" folder, you can then just drag
	the folders called "images" & "scripts" from your downloaded zip file into the "t6" folder.
	However if you already have the folders called "images" & "scripts" inside of your "t6" folder,
	just rename the previous mod folders to something else than "images" & "scripts" and then drag in the new folders.
	You can always change modified folder names back to "images" & "scripts" if you wish to play them again.



# INSTALLING AUDIO FILES

1. Replacing some audio files
	
	Head over to where your black ops 2 base game files are ( bo2 root folder )
	Find a folder called "sound" and open it.
	Next, drag the files called "zmb_common.all.sabs" & "zmb_nuked_real_all.sabs" from your downloaded zip file folder called "sound"
	into the "sound" folder that was located in your bo2 root folder.
	It will ask you to replace the files, click yes.
	
	You should now be ready to play the mod.

## I hope that you guys enjoy the mod.
### The mod heavily depends on having all the files loaded correctly.

  Mini EasterEgg Hint
  maybe pop off a few heads
  can you then find the head?
  grab it before it disappears
  stick the head to something sharp near where you believe the nerd is talking to you from
  maybe then feed the creature with some flesh
